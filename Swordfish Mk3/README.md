# **Swordfish Mk3**
My 5" analog 6S build that has the Apex HD frame as its base and uses the Diatone Mamba F405MK2 stack. Analog Camera/VTX combo and an ELRS 2.4GHz radio link.

## Camera setup:
### FPV:
An analog Caddx Baby Ratel 2 with superb low-light sensor for occasional sunset flights.
### Recording:
It can carry a full-size GoPro for capturing 4k60FPS footage.

## Antenna
Currently I really like flying the Foxeer Lollipop omnidirectional antennas that are 15cm long. It gives the Copter a lot of range and I don't need to factor in that the LiPo could hurt my signal reception when I'm flying towards myself.
